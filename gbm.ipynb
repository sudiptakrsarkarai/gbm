    "# Cricket Match Prediction with Brownian Motion üèè\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to model a cricket team's scoring progression using stochastic processes, specifically **Simple Brownian Motion (SBM)** and **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**. These models, originating from financial mathematics, can help us simulate potential score outcomes and estimate win probabilities by incorporating uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a hypothetical T20 chase scenario:\n",
    "* **Target:** 181 runs\n",
    "* **Overs:** 20 (120 balls)\n",
    "* **Chasing Team:** We will simulate their innings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to model the score not just as a straight line based on an average run rate, but as a random walk that drifts towards an average, accounting for the natural variance in scoring (e.g., a mix of dot balls, singles, and boundaries)."
